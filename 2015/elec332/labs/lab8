MODAL ANSWERS
------------------------------------------------------
Q0. How many Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) are there?
A0. 2, ATD0 and ATD1.

Q1. What is ATD0CTL2_ADPU?
A1. A single bit that, once set, powers up the ADC0. Not to be confused with
    ATD0CTL2 which is 8 bits that controls other aspects of the converter ADC0.

Q2. How to enable the other ADC?
A2. Same except for configuring registers that begin with "ATD1" instead of
    "ATD0". E.g. ATD1CTL2, ATD1CTL4, etc.


Q3. What does ATD0CTL4 = 0x85 mean?
A3. It means these:
    i.      ADC sample size is 8 bits (i.e. after sensor reading is quantized, its
            stored as an 8 bit number),

    ii.     Sample time length is 2, and the unit is ADC clock cycles (which in
            this lab is 2Mhz). I.e. 1 micro second (1/(2000000/2) seconds).

    iii.    5 is the prescaller specifier.


Q4. Explain how ATD0CTL4 = 0x85 means what it means?
A4. i.      Sample size is 8 bits when the 7th bit of ATD0CTL4 register is 1,
            and is 10 bits when the bit is 0.

    ii.     Bits 6 and 5 are the sample length specifier as follows:

        bit_6   bit_7   sample_len
        --------------------------
        0       0       2
        0       1       4
        1       0       8
        1       1       16

    iii.    The prescaller specifier (prescale_specifier) is used to obtain the
            prescaller using the equation below:

        prescaller = bus_clock/(prescale_specifier + 1)*0.5

Q5. What is the clock frequency of the convertor ATD0 as used in lab 8?
A5. prescaller = bus_clock/(prescale_specifier + 1)*0.5
               = 24000000/(5 + 1)*0.5
               = 2000000.
        
Q6. What does ATD0CTL5 = 0x87 mean?
A6.
    Justification:
        The variable by which the quantized values are stored in from the
        convertor ATD0 (or ATD1, same concept, but we used ATD0) is 16 bits
        long. But the ATD convertors can only quantize up to 10 bits. When 8
        bit sampling is used, the other 8 bits are unused. When 10 bit sampling
        is used, 6 bits are unused.  This leaves the question of justifying the
        bits.

        Setting ATD0CTL5's bit 7 to 1 enables right-justification, while
        setting it to 0 enables left-justification. This affects the value.

        E.g. 1: with 10 bit sampling and right-justification, a value of 682 is
        stored as follows:
                ---- --10 1010 1010
            And with left-justification:
                1010 1010 10-- ----

            "-"s are set to be 0s. I marked them by "-"s for visual clarity. So:
                ---- --10 1010 1010
            is actually:
                0000 0010 1010 1010
                682 in decimal

            Likewise:
                1010 1010 10-- ----
            is:
                1010 1010 1000 0000
                682 * 2^6 = 43648 in decimal

    Signing:
        Whether the numbers are signed (two's complement) or unsigned. Only
        applicable with left-justification.

    Scan mode:
        Whether scan mode is enabled. Once the bit ATD0CTL5_SCAN is set, the
        need to call the function ATD_CONVERT() is alleviated as the
        microcontroller automatically updates ATD0DR0 (in this case).

    Multi mode:
        Allows sampling from multiple channels instead of just one.
