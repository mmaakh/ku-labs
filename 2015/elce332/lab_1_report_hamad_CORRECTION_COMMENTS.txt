== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (20 pts) ===================
    1:
    + 0.9       the table shows the flags that are turned on/off, which
                is good. but the comments section essentially contains only
                the expanded name of the flags which doesn't add much value.
                e.g. it is trivial to know that C stands for Carry, but how
                does the uC defines it? similarly, it's trivial to know that V
                stands for Overflow, but how does the uC defines it?
                
                the uC turns the carry flag on when either carry or borrow
                happen to or from the most significant bit. the uC turns the
                overflow flag on when the addition or subtraction of two
                same-sign numbers results in another number with a different
                sign. these might seem mildly unintuitive but it's how the uC
                defines the flags -- a good comments section should explain
                this aspect instead of only expanding letters of flags.

                also you should have explained that the reason the carry flag
                was set in non-add/sub instructions is because they were
                simply not reset by the executed instructions such as LDAB.

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
9pts:
    + straight to the point. efficient use of space.
    + one code snippet has proper code indentation.
    - another code snippet doesn't
    - LST file is a screenshot of the whole window including excess bits.
    makes reading too hard as the font is extremely tiny.

    have a look at LaTeX.
