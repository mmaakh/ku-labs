== RESULTS & ANALYSIS (30 pts) =====================
    task 1 (30/3):
    + correct

    task 2 (30/3):
    + correct   you didn't exactly follow the question, but as this is
                a trivial aspect that doesn't affect the main task
                [subtracting A from B], no points are deducted

    task 3 (30/3):
    + correct

== SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS (10 pts) ====================

== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (20 pts) ===================
    1:
    + 0.95          
                i like the fact that you separate two things: setting the flag
                C, or not setting it, implying that it can be set because of a
                previous instruction. i.e. some instructions set it to 0, some
                set it to 1, and some just do nothing and let it have its
                previous value (by which you put '-').

                i also like that you explained why the carry bit was set. so
                far it seems that you're the only team that explained this.

                the only problem i see here is not explaining why the overflow
                flag was set.

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
9pts:
    + annotated figures.
    + the structure makes sense
    + proper code indentation.
    - some tables exceed the margin.

    have a look at LaTeX.
