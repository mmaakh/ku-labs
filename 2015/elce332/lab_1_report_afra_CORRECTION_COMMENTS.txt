    + correct   you didn't exactly follow the question, but as this is
                a trivial aspect that doesn't affect the main task
                [subtracting A from B], no points are deducted

== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (20 pts) ===================
    1:
    + 0.9       the table shows the flags that are turned on/off, which
                is good. but the comments section essentially contains only
                the expanded name of the flags which doesn't add much value.
                e.g. it is trivial to know that C stands for Carry, but how
                does the uC defines it? similarly, it's trivial to know that V
                stands for Overflow, but how does the uC defines it?
            
                the uC turns the carry flag on when either carry or borrow
                happen to or from the most significant bit. the uC turns the
                overflow flag on when the addition or subtraction of two
                same-sign numbers results in another number with a different
                sign. these might seem mildly unintuitive but it's how the uC
                defines the flags -- a good comments section should explain
                this aspect instead of only expanding letters of flags.

                also the 1st row for C doesn't show the carry bit (it exists
                as the uC didn't reset it as no relevant instruction was
                executed).

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
9pts:
    + annotated figures.
    + the structure makes sense
    - ToC missing bookmark.
    - improper code indentation.
    - table caption in table instead of above/below.
    - a code snippet is sometimes inlined with other text (e.g. page 9 followed
    by "this").
    - page 13, table exceeds margin borders.

    have a look at LaTeX.
