== RESULTS & ANALYSIS (40 pts) =====================
    task 1 (40/4):
    + correct.

    task 2 (40/4):
    - correct.

    task 3 (40/4):
    - correct:          the buzzer's frequency is not easily distinguishable by
                        humans.

    task 4 (40/4):
        - 0.1 correct:  interrupt source is IRQ not PTH, thus can't react to SW2.

                        doesn't work at startup (change "interrupt 6" to
                        "interrupt 25")

                        also interrupts on PTH are not enabled.

                        basically your code is closer to IRQ than PTH.
                        however, not even IRQ is enabled.

== SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS (10 pts) ====================
    10pts.

== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (20 pts) ===================
1 (20/2 pts):
    + 0.8 correct:      - using sw5 instead of sw3.
                        - when counter is moving backwards (after pressing
                          sw4), pressing sw3 will not display the current
                          counter as the count-down is done in the interrupt
                          itself. to make this work, you should put the
                          count-down out of the interrupt (to allow other
                          interrupts happen during the count-down)
                        - infinite loop in the interrupt routine.

2 (20/2 pts):
    + correct

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
8pts:
    - bad code indentation. 
    - too narrow column width for the code in assignment.
