== RESULTS & ANALYSIS (40 pts) =====================
    task 1 (40/5):
    + correct   

    task 2 (40/5):
    + correct   

    task 3 (40/5):
    + correct       you are one of very few teams who did the 0.5 sec sleep
                    right.  i appreciate calling 'delay' twice to achieve a
                    delay of 500msec because each instance of 'delay' can't
                    sleep more than 255msec (because it's argument is 8bits,
                    thus max is 2^8 - 1; i.e. delay(500) will not sleep for
                    500msec). this is an easy fix instead of writing your own
                    delay function.

== SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS (10 pts) ====================
    10pts.

== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (30 pts) ===================
1 (30/2 pts):
    + incorrect     this code doesn't compile for syntactic errors byond
                    creative MS Word automatic corrections. e.g. what does
                    this mean "if ((PTH==0) && (i!=));" note how it's ended by
                    a semi-colon ";".

                    delay(500) doesn't do what you think it does.

                    obvious logical flaws, e.g.: "if(PTH == 0) if(PTH_PTH2
                    ==1)", the 2nd condition is impossible to be true by
                    definition. probably a good compiler won't even generate a
                    machine code for it cause its existence only consumes
                    space.

2 (30/2 pts):
    - 0.9 correct   no support for fractions, which is strange as you used
                    LCDWriteFloat in the lab tasks but somehow you decided to
                    not use it in the assignment.

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
8pts:
    - bad code indentation. 
    - wrong code cases (e.g. Short -> short, For -> for).
