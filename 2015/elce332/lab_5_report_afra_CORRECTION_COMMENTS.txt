    10pts.

== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (20 pts) ===================
1 (20/2 pts):
    - incorrect lots of errors:
                - PORTB LEDs aren't initialized.
                - input from RS-232 aren't captured.
                - neither stored.
                - a single line with 'return' without a
                terminating semi colon. code won't even
                compile.

2 (20/2 pts):
    - incorrect     this code cannot work in most realistic string and will
                    easily get stuck in an infinite loop:
                        - len in SCI1_InString(char *, len) is set to 500,
                          while the actual length of the char array (or
                          string) is 100. this can cause buffer overflow --
                          Undefined Behaviour (UB), one of the worst things in
                          C.

                        - word = SCI1_InString(...) is meaningless as the
                          function returns void.

                        - the while loop that is meant to count chars/spaces
                          has logical flaws:
                            * it can get stuck in an infinite loop.
                            * 'len' doesn't mean anything stable. it might
                              work in some cases, but cannot work in all
                              cases.

                            reasons:
                            * the while loop's test variable 'sentence[count]'
                              will only advance when sentence[count] == 0x20.
                              what if we hit a char that is not equal to 0x20?
                              then it will stop incrementing. and when 'count'
                              stops incrementing, the 'while' loop will run
                              indefinitely.

                            * as the while loop is running indefinitely, 'len'
                              gets incrementing as well. thus 'len' is not
                              stable.
            
== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
8pts:
    - some code snippets overrun the margin.
    - bad code indentation.
