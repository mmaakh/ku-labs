== RESULTS & ANALYSIS (45 pts) =====================
    task 1 (45/2):
    + correct.

    task 2 (45/2):
    + correct.

== SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS (10 pts) ====================
    10pts.

== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (15 pts) ===================
1 (15/2 pts):
    - incorrect     errors are:
                    - PTH interrupts not enabled (e.g. PIEH). so PORTH_ISR
                      will never be called.

                    - you are using a single interrupt service routine for
                      time channel 2, while all your timer compare values are
                      for time channels 0 and 7! meaning, all the values that
                      you set for TC0 and TC7 will not change interrupt
                      intervals.

                    this code cannot generate any of the requested
                    frequencies.


2 (15/2 pts):
    - incorrect     - similar errors, read my comments for Leena's team,
                      basically:
                        * you didn't enable "input capture" on the some
                          channel to monitor the frequencies from the other
                          two channels. they all must be physically different
                          channels. e.g. if channels 0 and 7 are used to
                          generate frequencies 300Hz and 50Hz, then this new
                          channel for input compare must be something else,
                          such as channel 3 or whatever channel not used by
                          others.

                        * also, you defined two functions of the same name.
                          obviously this code won't even compile.

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
10pts:
    + straight to the point.
    - some code snippets overrun the margin.
    - bad code indentation.
