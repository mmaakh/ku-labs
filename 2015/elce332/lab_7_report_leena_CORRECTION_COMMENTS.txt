== ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS (15 pts) ===================
1 (15/2 pts):
    - 0.95 correct  - good. only one small typo: 95000 should be 9500 in
                      page 14.

                    well done.

2 (15/2 pts):
    - incorrect     - lots of errors:
                        * you need 3 channels: two for generating 50Hz and 300Hz
                          signals, and one for capturing the signals (input
                          capture) to measure their frequency.

                        * you have successfully configured channels 0 and 7 to be
                          "output capture" by setting their bits to 1 (TIOS_IOS0 =
                          1, TIOS_IOS7 = 1) in the previous assignment. but you
                          did not enable any "input capture" channel at all. the
                          steps for doing so are in the lab script (e.g. TIOS_IOS2
                          = 0 will enable channel 2 to operate in "input capture"
                          mode). there are a few other straight-forward steps as
                          listed in lab 7.

                        * but you simply reused timer channel 0 twice, once for
                          input capture and once for output compare -- this cannot
                          be done.

                        * then, you defined two functions with the same name. this
                          code should not even compile.

                    so far, as i'm correcting student labs, you are the only
                    student who even tried to tackle this question. so well done
                    for being the first to date to challenge this problem!

== REPORT PRESENTATION (10 pts) ====================
9pts:
    - some code snippets overrun the margin.
    - bad code indentation.
