correct answers:
----------------
q1. pc1 and pc2 are in different broadcast domains, that are interconnected by
    multiple routers. when pc1 does not have a default gateway configured, it
    does not send any message when told to ping pc2 (as it doesn't know the
    next hop address to reach pc2).

q2. when a default gateway is added to the pcs accordingly, their pings reaches
    their gateways. but since they gateways do not have a route to reach the
    ultimate destination, the routers stop there.

q3. when routers are configured with routing entries to identify reachabilty
    paths to target networks, pcs can ping each other successfully, therefore
    the path that such packet would cross is the full path.
